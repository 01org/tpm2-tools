# NAME

**tpm2_pcrlist**(1) - List PCR values.

# SYNOPSIS

**tpm2_pcrlist** [*OPTIONS*]

# DESCRIPTION

**tpm2_pcrlist**(1) - Displays PCR values. Without any options, **tpm2_pcrlist**(1)
outputs all pcrs and their hash banks. One can use either the **-g** or **-L**
mutually exclusive options to filter the output.

Output is written in a YAML format to stdout, with each algorithm followed by
a PCR index and its value. As a simple example assume just sha1 and sha256
support and only 1 PCR. The output would be:
```
$ tpm2_pcrlist -L sha1:0+sha256:0
sha1 :
  0  : 0000000000000000000000000000000000000003
sha256 :
  0  : 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003
```

# OPTIONS

  * **-g**, **\--halg**=_HASH\_ALGORITHM_:

    Only output PCR banks with the given algorithm.
    Algorithms should follow the "formatting standards", see section
    "Algorithm Specifiers".
    Also, see section "Supported Hash Algorithms" for a list of supported hash
    algorithms.

  * **-o**, **\--out-file**=_FILE_:

    The output file to write the PCR values in binary format, optional.

  * **-L**, **\--sel-list**=_PCR\_SELECTION\_LIST_:

    The list of PCR banks and selected PCRs' ids for each bank to display.
    _PCR\_SELECTION\_LIST_ values should follow the
    PCR bank specifiers standards, see section "PCR Bank Specifiers".

    Also read **NOTES** section below.

  * **-s**, **\--algs**:

    Output the list of supported algorithms.

# EXAMPLES

## Display all PCR values
```
tpm2_pcrlist
```

## Display the PCR values with a specified bank
```
tpm2_pcrlist -g sha1
```

## Display the PCR values with specified banks and store in a file
```
tpm2_pcrlist -L sha1:16,17,18+sha256:16,17,18 -o pcrs
```

## Display the supported PCR bank algorithms and exit
```
tpm2_pcrlist -s
```

# NOTES

The maximum number of PCR that can be dumped at once is associated
with the maximum length of a bank.

On most TPMs, it means that this tool can dump up to 24 PCRs
at once.
