.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool imports an external key (Symmetric AES-128) as TPM managed key object.
It requires the parent handle be persistent and an object of type RSA key.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-k\fR,\ \fB\-\-input-key-file\fR [filepath]
specifies the filename of symmetric key (128 bit data) to be imported.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR,\ \fB\-\-parent-key-handle\fR [string]
specifies the persistent parent key handle
.TP
\fB\-f\fR,\ \fB\-\-parent-key-public\fR [filepath] 
specifies the parent key public data file input. This can be read with 
tpm2_readpublic tool
.TP
\fB\-r\fR,\ \fB\-\-import-key-private\fR [filepath]
specifies the file path required to save the encrypted private portion of the object imported as key 
.TP
\fB\-q\fR,\ \fB\-\-import-key-public\fR [filepath] 
specifies the file path required to save the public portion of the object imported as key
