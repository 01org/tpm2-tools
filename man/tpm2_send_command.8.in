.TH tpm2_send_command 8 "NOVEMBER 2016" Intel "tpm2.0-tools"
.SH NAME
tpm2_send_command \- Send a command to the TPM using the specified TCTI.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tpm2_send_command
[\fBCOMMON OPTIONS\fR ] [\fBTCTI OPTIONS\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tpm2_send_command
is a command line tool used to send a TPM command to the TPM. The command is
read from a file as a binary stream and transmitted to the TPM using the TCTI
specified by the caller. The response received from the TPM is written to
the output file. If the input or output file is not specified, they default
to stdin and stdout respectively.
Likely the caller will want to redirect this to a file or into a
program to decode and display the response in a human readable form.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB\-i ,\-\-input\fR
