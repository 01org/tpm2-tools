# SYNOPSIS

authorization's capability to execute tpm2_clear. Only user with authorization
knowledge of the platform hierarchy can clear the disableClear. ** As an argument
the tool takes the _OPERATION_ as an integer 0|1 or string c|s to clear or set
the disableClear attribute. By default it attempts a CLEAR operation**
Note: Platform hierarchy auth handle can always be used to clear the TPM with
tpm2_clear command.

  * **-P**, **\--auth**=_HANDLE\_PASSWORD:
