# NAME

**tpm2_startauthsession**(1) - Start a session with the TPM.

# SYNOPSIS

**tpm2_startauthsession** [*OPTIONS*]

# DESCRIPTION

**tpm2_startauthsession**(1) - Starts a session with the TPM. The default is
to start a *trial* session unless the **-a** option is specified.
Saves the policy session data to a file. This file can then be used in subsequent
tools that can use a policy file for authorization or policy events.

This will not work with resource managers (RMs) outside of [tpm2-abrmd](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd), as most RMs will
flush session handles when a client disconnects from the IPC channel.

This will work with direct TPM access, but note that internally this calls a *ContextSave* and a *ContextLoad* on the session handle, thus the session **cannot** be saved/loaded again.

# OPTIONS

  * **--policy-session**:

    Start a policy session of type **TPM_SE_POLICY**. Default without this option
    is **TPM_SE_TRIAL**.
    **NOTE**: A *trial* session is used when building a policy and a *policy*
    session is used when authenticating with a policy.

  * **-g**, **--halg**=_HASH\_ALGORITHM_:

    The hash algorithm used in computation of the policy digest. Algorithms
    should follow the "formatting standards", see section "Algorithm Specifiers".
    Also, see section "Supported Hash Algorithms" for a list of supported hash
    algorithms.

  * **-S**, **--session**=_SESSION\_FILE\_NAME_:

    The name of the policy session file, optional. Defaults to *session.ctx*.
