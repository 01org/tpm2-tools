# NAME

**tpm2_import**(1) - Imports an external key into the tpm as a TPM managed key object.

# SYNOPSIS

**tpm2_import** [*OPTIONS*]

# DESCRIPTION

**tpm2_import**(1) - Imports an external generated key as TPM managed key object.
It requires that the parent key object be a RSA key. Can also import a TPM managed
key object created by the tpm2_duplicate tool.

# OPTIONS

These options control the key importation process:

  * **-G**, **\--algorithm**=_ALGORITHM_:

    The algorithm used by the key to be imported. Supports:
    * **aes** - AES 128, 192 or 256 key.
    * **rsa** - RSA 1024 or 2048 key.
    * **ecc** - ECC NIST P192, P224, P256, P384 or P521 public and private key.

  * **-g**, **\--halg**=_ALGORITHM_:

    The hash algorithm for generating the objects name. This is optional
    and defaults to **sha256** when not specified. Algorithms should follow the
    "formatting standards", see section "Algorithm Specifiers".
    Also, see section "Supported Hash Algorithms" for a list of supported
    hash algorithms.

  * **-i**, **\--infile**=_FILE_:

    Specifies the filename of symmetric key (128 bit data) to be imported. OR,
    Specifies the filename for the RSA2048 private key file in PEM and PKCS#1
    format. A typical file is generated with `openssl genrsa`.

  * **-C**, **\--parent-key**=_PARENT\_CONTEXT_:

    Specifies the context object for the parent key. Either a file or a handle number.
    See section "Context Object Format". The parent key **MUST** be an *RSA* key with an
    symmetric cipher of *aes128cfb*.

  * **-K**, **\--parent-pubkey**=_FILE_:

    Optional. Specifies the parent key public data file input. This can be read with
    **tpm2_readpublic**(1) tool. If not specified, the tool invokes a tpm2_readpublic on the parent
    object.

  * **-k**, **\--sym-alg-file**=_FILE_:

    Optional. Specifies the file containing the symmetric algorithm key that was used for the
    inner wrapper. If the file is specified the tool assumes the algorithm is AES 128 in CFB mode
    otherwise none.

  * **-r**, **\--privfile**=_FILE_:

    Specifies the file path required to save the encrypted private portion of
    the object imported as key.

    When importing a duplicated object this option specifies the file containing the
    private portion of the object to be imported.

  * **-u**, **\--pubfile**=_FILE_:

    Specifies the file path required to save the public portion of the object imported as key

    When importing a duplicated object this option specifies the file containing the
    public portion of the object to be imported.

  * **-b**, **\--object-attributes**=_ATTRIBUTES_:

    The object attributes, optional.

  * **-P**, **\--auth-parent**=_PARENT\_KEY\_AUTH_:

    The authorization value for using the parent key, optional.
    Authorization values should follow the "authorization formatting standards",
    see section "Authorization Formatting".

  * **-p**, **\--auth-key**=_KEY\_AUTH_:

    The authorization value for the key, optional.
    Follows the authorization formatting of the
    "password for parent key" option: **-P**.

  * **-L**, **\--policy-file**=_POLICY\_FILE_:

    The policy file.

  * **-s**, **\--seed**=_FILE_:

    Specifies the file containing the encrypted seed of the duplicated object.

  * **\--passin**=_OSSL\_PEM\_FILE\_PASSWORD_

    An optional password for an Open SSL (OSSL) provided input file. It mirrors the -passin option of
    OSSL and is known to support the pass, file, env, fd and plain password formats of openssl.
    (see *man(1) openssl*) for more.

# EXAMPLES

## To import a key, one needs to have a parent key
```
tpm2_createprimary -Grsa2048:aes128cfb -a o -o parent.ctx
```

Create your key and and import it. If you already have a key, just use that
and skip creating it.

## Import an AES 128 key
```
dd if=/dev/urandom of=sym.key bs=1 count=16

tpm2_import -C parent.ctx -i sym.key -u key.pub -r key.priv
```

## Import an RSA key
```
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

tpm2_import -C parent.ctx -G rsa -i private.pem -u key.pub -r key.priv
```

## Import an ECC key
```
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private.ecc.pem

tpm2_import -C parent.ctx -G ecc -i private.ecc.pem -u key.pub -r key.priv
```

## Import a duplicated key
```
tpm2_import -C parent.ctx -i key.dup -u key.pub -r key.priv -L policy.dat
```

# LIMITATIONS
  * The TPM requires that the name algorithm of the child be smaller than the parent.
  * Parents with a SHA1 hash algorithm currently fail. See bug
    [#119](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools/issues/1119) for details.

# RETURNS

0 on success or 1 on failure.
