.SH NAME
tpm2_pcrextend\ - Extend PCR(s).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tpm2_pcrextend
[ COMMON OPTIONS ] [ TCTI OPTIONS ] [ PCR_DIGEST_SPEC... ]
.PP
.B tpm2_pcrextend
Extends the pcrs with values indicated by PCR_DIGEST_SPEC.

A PCR_DIGEST_SPEC is defined as follows:
  - A numerical pcr identifier.
  - A colon followed by the algorithm hash specification.
  The algorithm hash specification is as follows:
    -The algorithm friendly name or raw numerical.
    -An equals sign.
    -The hex hash value.

Example Digest Specification:
.Dl
  4:sha=f1d2d2f924e986ac86fdf7b36c94bcdf32beec15

Note that multiple specifications of PCR and hash are OK. Multiple hashes
cause the pcr to be extended with both hashes. Multiple same PCR values cause
the PCR to be extended multiple times. Extension is done in order from left to
right as specified. At most 5 hash extensions per PCR entry are supported. This
is to keep the parser simple.
